# Panabsorbium
![Why red and white? Because I like red and white, that's why. Boros represent](http://puu.sh/g2sdz/0038d5f423.png)

## What
This is a mod for the game Stonehearth. It's a simple armour mod with a crafting chain. Adds the following:
  * A Panabsorbium ingot, made with 4 silver ingots, 2 gold ingots, and 1 wood resource
  * A Panabsorbium Vest, made with 4 Panabsorbium ingots, a cloth, and a thread, and providing 15 defense
  * A speed-increasing buff for the wearer of the Vest

## Why
There are currently no uses for gold and silver. I wanted a functional sink for those resources (e.g. not just decoration). Just making a tougher stronger armour didn't have enough "oomph" over the existing Steel Mail, so this vest also adds a speed buff to the footman wearing it.

I also wanted to have a very simple reference for adding new stuff into the game, as an introduction to modding Stonehearth. I will refer to it when I need to copy-paste a Stonehearth project seed. Feel free to use it as a starting basis for your own materials / crafting chain mod. 

## Who
A huge thank you to [@honestabelink](http://discourse.stonehearth.net/users/honestabelink/) for creating the [Lua Unminifier](http://discourse.stonehearth.net/t/lua-unminifier-formatter-improved/8217) and the awesome [StoneVox](http://discourse.stonehearth.net/t/stonevox-3d-community-voxel-modeler-for-stonehearth-v-0-0-6/8664), which I've both used in the creation of this mod, and am seeing myself use for future SH mods. Another thank you to [@RepeatPan](http://discourse.stonehearth.net/users/repeatpan) for giving me a run-down on SH's mixin/mixinto system. And of course to Radiant for creating this awesome game.

This mod was written by me, [@Moai](http://discourse.stonehearth.net/users/moai). I bastardized Radiant's Cloth Padded Vest matrix and the Devoted buff icon (in MS Paint, no less) for the armour and buff icon assets, respectively.

## More
If you're a beginner to modding like myself, you might want to check out the `Notes.md` file included with this mod, which documents some of what I've learned while making this mod, as well as a handy reference if you want to mess with this armour yourself. If you're a pro, you can still check it out and let me know if I'm incorrect / missed something.
